            <p>For this school project I had to clone a real website using HTML and CSS. I chose for the Maxaro website
                since it has a lot of different elements and layout which made it challenging to clone. The website also
                needed to be
                fully reponsive which made it even more challenging.</p>

                alt="picture of the maxaro clone landingscreen">

            <p>In the beginning I made a breakdown sketch where I was grouping certain elements with each other. After
                that I started with coding. This had been the third time I had to develop a website using HTML and CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides cloning and making it responsive I also had to add some micro interactions. Therefore I added
                some animations on hover on certain elements to make the website more dynamic in compared to the orginal
                site.

                alt="picture of the maxaro clone product page">
            <p>The code had to meet certain criteria, it had to be semantic HTML and we had to use as few classes, id's
                , and divs as possible. This made me to be more creative while positioning elements. For example,
                I had to use grid more often for certain layouts, which were easier to code if I could use div's. Besides the code, the accessibility of the website was also important.
            </p>
            <p>During this project I further developed my CSS skills where I learned new topics such as using custom
                properties, grid, different css properties, and animations. On top of that I also learned to develop responsive website using
                relative units and media queries, plus I learned where to focus at when I develop a website regarding the accessibility so that any person regardless of injury or disability are able to use my website.</p>
