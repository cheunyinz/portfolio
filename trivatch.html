            <p>For this project I had the idea for a travel app which targeted to those between the ages of 18 and 50.
                Based on user choices, the app would show suited destinations for holidays. I designed the app's
                wireframes to bring my concept to life, starting with the user account setup, preference choosing, and
                recommendations display pages.</p>

                My focus for this project was primarily on the back-end development, as I wanted to experiment with new
                technologies. As a result, the app's designs remained minimalistic and simple. In exploring different
                template engines, In the beginning I chose EJS due to its beginner-friendly reputation. However, after
                encountering some syntax difficulties, I switched to Handlebars, which offered a more intuitive syntax
                and it was more popular than EJS according to multiple sources.

            <p> To enable data storage and retrieval, I used MongoDB as the app's database system. First I tried using
                the MongoDB extension instead of Mongoose, I later realized the limitations and challenges in
                finding support for MongoDB's own extension. Nonetheless, I successfully implemented functionality that
                allowed users to add trips to the database, including uploading photos using Multer. Additionally, users
                could receive recommendations based on their preferences by submitting a form and retrieving data from
                the database.

            <p>For this project I also had to use different API’s. Therefore I explored the Geolocation API and Reverse
                Geocoding API for location-based features but faced difficulties in implementation. As a solution, I
                switched to utilizing the Local Storage API to enable seamless data transfer between pages, such as
                storing and retrieving the user's origin country selection. Additionally, I used progressive enhancement
                by implementing JavaScript to enhance user interactions, such as adding trips and displaying pop-up
                notifications.</p>

            <p>Throughout the development process, I had challenges in understanding backend concepts, APIs, and
                data integration. However, through research, seeking help from teachers and student
                assistants, and using online resources like YouTube tutorials, I overcame obstacles and deepened my
                understanding. During this project I have made significant progress in achieving
                the project goals and enhancing my skills in frontend and backend development.</p>
